This repository contains the files:
- [div_p_bandits.py](https://github.com/H2DI/diversity_preserving_band_sim/blob/main/bandits_lab/bandit_definitions/div_p_bandits.py) which implements the diversity-preserving bandit problem
- [div_p_algorithms.py](https://github.com/H2DI/diversity_preserving_band_sim/blob/main/bandits_lab/algorithms/div_p_algorithms.py) which implements the Div-P-UCB algorithm, and the L1-OFUL algorithm
- [Diversity_preserving_bandits.ipynb](https://github.com/H2DI/diversity_preserving_band_sim/blob/main/Diversity_preserving_bandits.ipynb) used to run simulations and produce the plots in the article.

Run the cells of the notebook in order to reproduce the figure.
